Using CSS3 Transitions & Animations
===================================

Talk given at [Async Brighton](http://asyncjs.com/) on [Thursday 24th 
June 2010](http://asyncjs.com/css3).

Slides available at [aron.github.com/async-css3-talk](aron.github.com/async-css3-talk).

Overview
--------

This session, led by Aron Carroll, will explore the use of CSS transitions 
and animations as an alternative to traditional JavaScript methods. 
Although animations are still just a proposed part of the CSS3 spec, 
enough browsers have now added support that it is worth considering 
them a tool for use in your projects.

The talk will cover implementation of CSS animations in both CSS and 
JavaScript, browser coverage, progressive enhancement for unsupported 
browsers and a look into current limitations of the specification. 

Having some knowledge of both CSS and JavaScript will be useful but 
should not be necessary to follow the talk.
